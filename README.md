# Kaggle Data Analysis Project: AI Job Market and Salary Trends

This project aims to strengthen my skills in NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, while also giving me hands-on experience with basic statistics and data analysis techniques.

The dataset, originally hosted on Kaggle, has since been taken down. It was previously available at the following link:
`https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bismasajjad/global-ai-job-market-and-salary-trends-2025/data`

## Project Structure: 
1. Root folder:
    * 2 `CSV` files (one containing the original dataset, and another containing the cleaned version).
    * Python file `data_cleaning.py`: Main script for preprocessing data.
2. Subfolders:
    * `salary_analysis`, `skills_analysis`, contain scripts that explore different project objectives.
3. PDF Report:
    * A PDF report summarizing the methodology, analysis, and key findings of the project.
